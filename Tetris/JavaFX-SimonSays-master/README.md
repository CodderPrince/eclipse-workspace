# JavaFX-SimonSays
A very simple Simon Says game in which the player needs to follow and remember the pattern of blinking colors in order to win.

## Usage
If you only want to play the game, there is an [executable .jar](SimonSays.jar) in which you can run or if you want to modify the code, the code is in [/src/application](/src/application).
